# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Project Description
This is the first step in creating the AirBnB clone. The goal is to develop a command-line interpreter that can manage various objects in our AirBnB system. The system will eventually evolve into a fully functional web application with a database, front-end integration, and much more.

### Features
- Create new objects (User, State, City, Place, etc.)
- Retrieve objects from the storage
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy objects
- Count and perform operations on objects

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter allows interaction with the objects in your AirBnB system through simple commands. You can create, retrieve, update, and destroy objects in a simple shell-like environment.

### How to Start the Console:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aman-Kasa/alu-AirBnB_clone.git
   cd alu-AirBnB_clone
